# Global-Wellbeing-Through-Economic-Energy-Trends
This project explores global socio-economic patterns using World Bank data, focusing on GDP, internet usage, and life expectancy. It highlights regional and income group disparities through data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations, offering insights into development gaps and global trends.


World Development Indicators Analysis Project
This project analyzes global economic and social indicators using Python data visualization techniques to uncover insights into development patterns across countries and regions.
Project Objectives
This analysis explores multiple dimensions of global development through five key perspectives:
1. GDP & GDP per Capita Trends Across Income Groups

Goal: Analyze economic growth patterns across Low, Middle, and High-Income countries over time
Visualizations: Line plots & area charts grouped by income category
Key Questions: How do growth rates differ? Is there evidence of convergence or divergence?

2. Relationship Between Life Expectancy and GDP

Goal: Investigate correlation between economic prosperity and health outcomes
Visualizations: Scatter plots with regression lines or animated bubble charts over time
Key Questions: How strong is the relationship? Are there diminishing returns at higher income levels?

3. Regional Birth & Death Rate Trends

Goal: Track demographic transitions across different geographic regions
Visualizations: Dual line plots or grouped bar charts by region
Key Questions: Which regions show the most dramatic demographic shifts? Are birth and death rates converging?

4. Internet Usage Growth vs. GDP per Capita

Goal: Examine digital divide patterns and technology adoption correlations with income
Visualizations: Heatmaps or scatter plots colored by region/income group
Key Questions: How closely does digital inclusion follow economic development? Which regions show unique patterns?

5. Countries with Fastest Life Expectancy Improvements

Goal: Identify success stories in health outcome advancements
Visualizations: Bar charts showing delta values between earliest and latest years by country
Key Questions: Which factors correlate with rapid improvements? Are there regional patterns?
